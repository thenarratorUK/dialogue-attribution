1. Unknown: “I smell him,”
2. Unknown: “He’s close.”
3. Unknown: “Pray we don’t find him, Zack.”
4. Unknown: “He’ll kill us if he finds us here,”
5. Unknown: “We’ll die a gruesome death. I fear his transformation will not be an easy one. He could be the last of our kind—”
6. Unknown: “Our kind?”
7. Unknown: “We’re no longer Drakkon. We’re men now. We belong to the human race.”
8. Unknown: “We had a choice,”
9. Unknown: “He doesn’t.”
10. Unknown: “In the end, it will be his choice.”
11. Unknown: “He’s an Aqua,”
12. Unknown: “Surely several hundred years has not dulled your memory enough to forget the arrogance of his color genus. He fought over a hundred Reds and received nothing but a slightly scorched tail. He’ll never choose to live as a man. He won’t turn over the treasure—”
13. Unknown: “Which is exactly why Patrick wants him altered as soon as possible.”
14. Unknown: “Careful with your thoughts, Zack,”
15. Unknown: “If he’s here, you will alert him to our presence. You know he can hear even better than we can.”
16. Unknown: “Patrick is a fool to believe Marrkiya will give up his treasure.”
17. Unknown: “It is not complex,”
18. Unknown: “Marrkiya either obeys the law of the Council or he dies. We have enough golden arrows to send him back to the stars.”
19. Unknown: “Tomias,”
20. Unknown: “Pye jora kihoit ’n evorta sime adorna, Tomias?”
21. Unknown: “I-I can no longer understand the language, Marrkiya.”
22. Unknown: “Pye jora hittu lmaie sike ’n dyrtre fra Lacodanay.”
23. Unknown: “I don’t…”
24. Unknown: “No! I…”
25. Unknown: “We came to deliver a message to you, Marrkiya. You didn’t have to kill them. Two were not even Drakkon.”
26. Unknown: “Marrkiya.”
27. Unknown: “Since the beginning of the Great Transformation, we have lived peacefully among mankind. We were hunted as Drakkons, killed for sport. But now, our only threat is you.”
28. Unknown: “Are you smiling? Yes, we’re afraid of you, Drakkon. Does that satisfy you? You’ve burned many of our homes. You’ve made many of our lives a living hell for the last eight centuries, having to hide our families from you.”
29. Unknown: “You’ve defied every law, and now Patrick is going to transform you himself.”
30. Unknown: “You have seven days left as a Drakkon and then he’ll use the Phoenix Amber to end your reign of terror. You will still have use of some of your power, as we all did after the change. You will remain immortal. Your fire will be gone, of course, but your wings will remain for a few months. You must exercise caution using them though, for you will be living in man’s world.”
31. Unknown: “He wants something he thinks you have.”
32. Unknown: “A treasure. A very special treasure.”
33. Unknown: “A thousand hoards cannot compare to what this treasure is worth,”
34. Unknown: “I will tell you after you transform. You have my word.”
35. Unknown: “I brought you some tea, dear.”
36. Unknown: “How many stones do you think we’ll need to fill it?”
37. Unknown: “Twelve should do it.”
38. Unknown: “I guess it’s a good time to learn how to be less of a perfectionist. I’ll have to live with it for now.”
39. Unknown: “And those too. Just don’t walk under them for a few months, Ellie.”
40. Unknown: “Come, dear,”
41. Unknown: “It’s getting late. Come inside and I’ll make you some supper before I leave.”
42. Unknown: “What in blazes was that?”
43. Unknown: “Maybe it was thunder,”
44. Unknown: “Oh great! Just great.”
45. Unknown: “What in the name of the saints happened there?”
46. Unknown: “We don’t know what it is.”
47. Unknown: “Come on, Ellie.”
48. Unknown: “It could have been a meteor or something. They give you money for space rocks around here, don’t they?”
49. Unknown: “He’s alive.”
50. Unknown: “He must have fallen from a plane.”
51. Unknown: “Then he should be dead,”
52. Unknown: “He’s freezing,”
53. Unknown: “We need to get help, Ellie. Where’s the nearest hospital?”
54. Unknown: “It’s all right.”
55. Unknown: “We’re going to get you help.”
56. Unknown: “Sam?”
57. Unknown: “What is it?”
58. Unknown: “I think he’s awake. He just spoke to me.”
59. Unknown: “Hello? Can you hear me? You need help. You fell from a…”
60. Unknown: “…from something. I think your leg is broken so don’t move. Though, how you’re alive, is beyond me.”
61. Unknown: “Samantha, he’s unconscious. What are you doing, dear?”
62. Unknown: “He must be coming to. He just said he didn’t want help.”
63. Unknown: “He doesn’t want help?”
64. Unknown: “Why on earth wouldn’t he want help?”
65. Unknown: “He must be delirious. He doesn’t realize what’s happened.”
66. Unknown: “We need to call—”
67. Unknown: “What’s the matter, child?”
68. Unknown: “What is it?”
69. Unknown: “I thought…”
70. Unknown: “I thought he…”
71. Unknown: “I’ve been worrying about this place too much. I need to de-stress. For a crazy minute, I thought he spoke to me in my mind, like telepathically or something. They were my own thoughts, of course, but it sounded so real.”
72. Unknown: “Samantha, dear, let’s go back inside. We will get some help for the wretched man and…”
73. Unknown: “He doesn’t want any help.”
74. Unknown: “It’s dead.”
75. Unknown: “He probably hit the wires on his way down,”
76. Unknown: “Down from where?”
77. Unknown: “I don’t know.”
78. Unknown: “We can use the quilt to wrap him up and take him to the hospital ourselves.”
79. Unknown: “No, his back could be broken,”
80. Unknown: “I don’t think we should try to move him. Besides, he’s too big for the both of us. We probably can’t budge him.”
81. Unknown: “You’re right. Go home and call the hospital from your phone, El. I’ll be okay. I’ll keep him warm till help arrives.”
82. Unknown: “Samantha, come with me. It will take more than an hour for help to get here and I don’t want to leave you here alone with him.”
83. Unknown: “He’s unconscious and his leg is badly broken. I don’t think he’s any threat to me. I was imagining things earlier. Go. Please. Get him some help. I’ll be fine.”
84. Unknown: “I don’t think he’ll be waking up anytime soon. He does need to be seen by a doctor. I’ll make the call as soon as I get home and see you in the morning.”
85. Unknown: “Poor thing,”
86. Unknown: “You’re going to hurt when you wake up.”
87. Unknown: “Are you…talking to me?”
88. Unknown: “God help me, you are talking to me!”
89. Unknown: “What…what are you? Are you an angel?”
90. Unknown: “It’s okay. You’re safe,”
91. Unknown: “Don’t try to move,”
92. Unknown: “You fell from…”
93. Unknown: “You had a great fall and your leg is broken.”
94. Unknown: “What happened to you?”
95. Unknown: “Where did you come from?”
96. Unknown: “Va hevita.”
97. Unknown: “What? Heaven?”
98. Unknown: “Is that you I’m hearing in my head?”
99. Unknown: “How?”
100. Unknown: “How are you doing that? And why can I understand you that way and not when you talk with your mouth? Am I nuts? Are you nuts? Have I finally cracked like the walls outside my—?”
101. Unknown: “What happened to you?”
102. Unknown: “Fra semer lacodanay,”
103. Unknown: “Of course, you’re a man.”
104. Unknown: “Are you an angel…Drakkon?”
105. Unknown: “Fra seme Drakkon.”
106. Unknown: “Drakkon,”
107. Unknown: “Your name is Drakkon, I got that part.”
108. Unknown: “Stop that,”
109. Unknown: “You’re telling me you’re a dragon?”
110. Unknown: “Okay.”
111. Unknown: “Marrkiya, the Drakkon, you just rest now and I’m sure tomorrow you’ll be a dragon again.”
112. Unknown: “Don’t!”
113. Unknown: “How…?”
114. Unknown: “Please don’t,”
115. Unknown: “Please, don’t hurt me.”
116. Unknown: “Any sign of him yet, Aldric?”
117. Unknown: “Sentries report the skies are clear.”
118. Unknown: “He’s coming. He’s just passed the Grampian Mountains.”
119. Unknown: “Treca Padgora?”
120. Unknown: “Baseta, fracina lacodan,”
121. Unknown: “Marrkiya,”
122. Unknown: “We can no longer understand the language. You possess the power to speak like us now. All you have to do is think about what you want to say.”
123. Unknown: “You have much to say, friend. I would like to hear it and understand.”
124. Unknown: “If you hadn’t changed me, you would be nothing but a pile of ashes right now. You are not my friend.”
125. Unknown: “Puny, worthless men,”
126. Unknown: “Man, as you are now,”
127. Unknown: “And your name from this day forth is Marcus Aquara.”
128. Unknown: “But I am neither weak nor puny, am I, Padgora?”
129. Unknown: “Marrkiya!”
130. Unknown: “Please,”
131. Unknown: “Marrkiya, if you harm my family—”
132. Unknown: “What?”
133. Unknown: “What will you do, man of peace?”
134. Unknown: “Enough!”
135. Unknown: “Marcus, we are prepared to destroy you. ’Tis something we have avoided at all costs, but if you continue on your path toward carnage, you will leave us no choice. We have sentries at the ready.”
136. Unknown: “You think you have not destroyed me already?”
137. Unknown: “We did what we had to do.”
138. Unknown: “You destroyed the last of the Drakkon, fool!”
139. Unknown: “You let Padgora annihilate our race for his own greed. The Drakkon are no longer.”
140. Unknown: “Not necessarily and you know it,”
141. Unknown: “What the hell does that mean?”
142. Unknown: “Your reign of terror is over, Marcus.”
143. Unknown: “You are no longer a threat to us.”
144. Unknown: “Change me back, or I promise the end of your days, along with your family’s, will come quickly and mercilessly.”
145. Unknown: “And if I do, what is to stop you from coming after us with your fire?”
146. Unknown: “Patrick,”
147. Unknown: “You swore on the Amber that you would restore him after he turns over the treasure.”
148. Unknown: “Ah, my treasure,”
149. Unknown: “You are a greedy whoreson, Padgora. You do all this for my hoard.”
150. Unknown: “On the contrary. Your hoard will be combined with ours. How else do you think we have survived all these years? We need riches to live in this world, to provide for our many families.”
151. Unknown: “Very well,”
152. Unknown: “Take mine then, and live your meaningless existence here.”
153. Unknown: “I fully intend to take it, and to keep my promise to return you to your natural state,”
154. Unknown: “But your hoard is not enough.”
155. Unknown: “You think me a fool, Marcus? The instant you breathe fire again we will be dust. I want more than your hoard to ensure your compliance to leave us alone. I want what you treasure most.”
156. Unknown: “Aye. The treasure you believe I possess. The treasure worth more than a thousand hoards.”
157. Unknown: “We want it,”
158. Unknown: “I don’t have it.”
159. Unknown: “We know you do, Marcus. Hand it over and be changed back. Refuse and remain a man.”
160. Unknown: “If you desire my hoard, then find it.”
161. Unknown: “But know this, Padgora, I will take that which you value above all else. And someday, whether I am a man or Drakkon, I will return and kill you. You will not be gathered back to the stars as the Drakkon have been for centuries. You will rot in the ground, receiving neither heaven nor hell as your place of rest because you are neither Drakkon nor man.”
162. Unknown: “Marcus, you are hereby banned from appearing before this Council again until you are ready to relinquish your treasure to us.”
163. Unknown: “You will have lost all by then,”
164. Unknown: “Do you have to leave, baby?”
165. Unknown: “Do you want your husband to find me here?”
166. Unknown: “Where is the Armani sweater I bought you?”
167. Unknown: “Brought it back,”
168. Unknown: “I finished your painting, Amanda.”
169. Unknown: “You did?”
170. Unknown: “Where is it?”
171. Unknown: “Downstairs. Wait until I leave before you look at it.”
172. Unknown: “What a treasure you are, Manda,”
173. Unknown: “Know that I have enjoyed you thoroughly. But now I must go.”
174. Unknown: “Tell your husband that the Drakkon thanks him for his riches.”
175. Unknown: “He doesn’t love you and he isn’t coming back,”
176. Unknown: “You were revenge against me and nothing more.”
177. Unknown: “You guys better grow next spring,”
178. Unknown: “I need to see some kind of improvement around here.”
179. Unknown: “Greetings, Sam,”
180. Unknown: “Stay away!”
181. Unknown: “I mean it. Don’t come any closer.”
182. Unknown: “Nothing lands with more grace than Drakkon,”
183. Unknown: “You haven’t changed.”
184. Unknown: “What?”
185. Unknown: “What are you?”
186. Unknown: “I’m Drakkon, remember?”
187. Unknown: “Oh, dear God!”
188. Unknown: “Please go away. Please go away,”
189. Unknown: “Oh, please, please go away.”
190. Unknown: “I will not hurt you,”
191. Unknown: “I did not realize how fair you were when I first saw you, Sam.”
192. Unknown: “You’re not real.”
193. Unknown: “But I am.”
194. Unknown: “I dreamed of you.”
195. Unknown: “Why…why did you come back?”
196. Unknown: “I remembered falling.”
197. Unknown: “And then I remembered you.”
198. Unknown: “I really wish you hadn’t come back,”
199. Unknown: “Do you want me to leave, Samantha?”
200. Unknown: “Yes, I do. Right now, please.”
201. Unknown: “I’m going,”
202. Unknown: “Thank you, and goodbye.”
203. Unknown: “Sam.”
204. Unknown: “I’m staying with you this time.”
205. Unknown: “I’m coming down!”
206. Unknown: “Why do you think you’re a dragon?”
207. Unknown: “Because that is what I am.”
208. Unknown: “All right.”
209. Unknown: “If you really expect me to believe all this, you’ll have to explain how you came to be a man.”
210. Unknown: “Can we talk over some lunch? I am starving.”
211. Unknown: “So, this Padgora changed you knowing you didn’t want to be a man?”
212. Unknown: “Aye, he wants my hoard.”
213. Unknown: “Your…hoard?”
214. Unknown: “My treasure,”
215. Unknown: “It is very great.”
216. Unknown: “Right,”
217. Unknown: “He’d agreed to transform me back once I surrendered it, but he went back on his word and demands more.”
218. Unknown: “What more does he want?”
219. Unknown: “I don’t know.”
220. Unknown: “He has already taken what I value the most.”
221. Unknown: “Someone is coming.”
222. Unknown: “He’s…um…fixing my wall, Eric,”
223. Unknown: “I hired him this morning.”
224. Unknown: “Ahem.”
225. Unknown: “How long do you think you’ll be here, ehm…?”
226. Unknown: “Marcus, and a few months, at least,”
227. Unknown: “Are you ready, Sam?”
228. Unknown: “Tell him you’re not going anywhere with him,”
229. Unknown: “Excuse me?”
230. Unknown: “Tell him you’re not going,”
231. Unknown: “Let me get Drak…”
232. Unknown: “…my horse.”
233. Unknown: “sway to her hips.”
234. Unknown: “Be a good horse, Drakkon.”
235. Unknown: “This is too weird.”
236. Unknown: “What?”
237. Unknown: “Nothing.”
238. Unknown: “My God, I’m as insane as he is.”
239. Unknown: “I told you to sleep in the servant’s quarters.”
240. Unknown: “I’m not a servant,”
241. Unknown: “Thank you for fixing my wall.”
242. Unknown: “You’re welcome, Sam.”
243. Unknown: “Oh, good morning, dear.”
244. Unknown: “Sam,”
245. Unknown: “Why didn’t you tell me Ellie would be here this morning? I frightened her half to death.”
246. Unknown: “I didn’t know I had to tell you.”
247. Unknown: “Do you want an itinerary of my entire life?”
248. Unknown: “No, I enjoy surprises. It keeps the blood rushing,”
249. Unknown: “You only frightened me for a moment, Marcus,”
250. Unknown: “You were very sweet afterward. Sam, did you know that Marcus has never been to the cinema? I told him he looks like a young Robert Taylor, only a lot rougher ’round the edges, and he had no idea who I meant.”
251. Unknown: “It was a good thing I was here, eh, dear?”
252. Unknown: “He was bent on waking you up two hours ago.”
253. Unknown: “I was lonely for you.”
254. Unknown: “Liar,”
255. Unknown: “It’s so kind of Marcus to fix the wall, isn’t it, Sam?”
256. Unknown: “Ellie,”
257. Unknown: “This is the guy who fell through the stable roof!”
258. Unknown: “Yes, I know.”
259. Unknown: “And it doesn’t strike you as odd to see him back here?”
260. Unknown: “No, dear. Should it?”
261. Unknown: “He could be an axe murderer!”
262. Unknown: “Oh, what drivel. If he were an axe murderer, you would be dead by now.”
263. Unknown: “Besides, you’re from New York. You wouldn’t let someone into your home that you didn’t trust. I like Marcus,”
264. Unknown: “I had to cover him up though. I had a shirt at the shop, but I promised to take him shopping next week.”
265. Unknown: “So,”
266. Unknown: “Marcus tells me he used to be a Drag…Drakkon.”
267. Unknown: “You mean you believe him?”
268. Unknown: “Well, of course, I didn’t at first, but he didn’t get those wings from flight school, my dear,”
269. Unknown: “You showed her your wings?”
270. Unknown: “Aye.”
271. Unknown: “Nearly sucked the life right out of me when I saw them,”
272. Unknown: “But there was no other way the poor man could prove that he wasn’t a psychopath.”
273. Unknown: “Marcus, you can’t go around whipping those things out to everyone you meet!”
274. Unknown: “Why not?”
275. Unknown: “Because they’ll lock you up!”
276. Unknown: “And then you would miss me.”
277. Unknown: “No, I’d probably celebrate!”
278. Unknown: “If I had known how good cooked meat tastes, I would have breathed my fire on all those pigs before I ate them.”
279. Unknown: “Oh!”
280. Unknown: “D OES SHE HAVE an affinity for pigs, then?”
281. Unknown: “I think this might be a bit much for her to swallow.”
282. Unknown: “I’ve seen many things in my life that can’t be explained, including the evil in a person’s heart. It’s easier for me to accept things. Even something as wildly strange as this. Sam has lived a very sheltered life with no firm foundation. When she bought this castle, I think she was hoping for a knight, not a dragon.”
283. Unknown: “Knights, ha!”
284. Unknown: “They were nothing more than snacks, and foul ones at that. They were no match against me.”
285. Unknown: “I am Drakkon. Why would Sam prefer a mere knight when she could have the strength of a Drakkon at her side?”
286. Unknown: “Oh, you are delightful.”
287. Unknown: “More bacon, dear?”
288. Unknown: “She’s a stubborn wench.”
289. Unknown: “Who, dear?”
290. Unknown: “Sam.”
291. Unknown: “She refuses to answer me.”
292. Unknown: “You really can communicate with her telepathically?”
293. Unknown: “Oh, my!”
294. Unknown: “What else can you do?”
295. Unknown: “Not much anymore,”
296. Unknown: “But I plan on remedying that.”
297. Unknown: “Really? How?”
298. Unknown: “Padgora wants something priceless before he will change me back. A treasure like no other. I don’t know what it is yet, but I plan on finding out.”
299. Unknown: “Then the legends are true,”
300. Unknown: “Dragons really do hoard their treasures.”
301. Unknown: “Drakkon,”
302. Unknown: “And aye, we are possessive of what belongs to us.”
303. Unknown: “Don’t you already have a treasure then? Give it to him and get your life back.”
304. Unknown: “I tried to do just that,”
305. Unknown: “He wants more, greedy son of a whore that he is. He wants something from me that I don’t have.”
306. Unknown: “Where will you find this treasure?”
307. Unknown: “I do not know.”
308. Unknown: “I have lost much of my Drakkon abilities.”
309. Unknown: “Well, in the meantime, you’ll just have to learn how to do new things. More tea?”
310. Unknown: “I can paint. Mayhap I will paint a castle for Sam.”
311. Unknown: “That would be lovely, dear,”
312. Unknown: “She writes about castles, no?”
313. Unknown: “Yes, she’s a romance novelist.”
314. Unknown: “Romance?”
315. Unknown: “That’s right. Historicals.”
316. Unknown: “Ask her about A Quest for Honor and Sir Tristan.”
317. Unknown: “I must speak to Sam.”
318. Unknown: “Sir Edward Bartholomew led a score of his own men into my lair and stood aside while I scorched the flesh from their bones. Knowing I had exhausted my fire, he cleverly avoided my claws and proceeded to jab me with his sword until day became night. That is getting on one’s nerves.”
319. Unknown: “What did you do?”
320. Unknown: “I ate him. What do you think I did?”
321. Unknown: “And you’re proud of that?”
322. Unknown: “What choice did I have?”
323. Unknown: “Back off,”
324. Unknown: “I don’t like that look in your eyes.”
325. Unknown: “What look?”
326. Unknown: “Like I’m your next meal.”
327. Unknown: “I only want to kiss you, Sam.”
328. Unknown: “Don’t be afraid,”
329. Unknown: “I’m told I kiss rather nicely.”
330. Unknown: “Well, I’m glad you haven’t wasted any time adjusting to your new body.”
331. Unknown: “I’m a swift learner.”
332. Unknown: “Give yourself to me, Sam,”
333. Unknown: “No!”
334. Unknown: “What was that? What did you do to me? Is that why you’re here? Because I’m a…Oh, dear God, it is, isn’t it? You’re a dragon and I’m a virgin!”
335. Unknown: “Nay, Sam.”
336. Unknown: “I…”
337. Unknown: “It is who I am.”
338. Unknown: “Cast away your knights,”
339. Unknown: “You have me to be your firm foundation now.”
340. Unknown: “After you take me against my will and burn me to ashes? No, thank you.”
341. Unknown: “I am incapable of such a thing.”
342. Unknown: “Oh really? Then what would you call…that?”
343. Unknown: “Every virgin I took came to me willingly,”
344. Unknown: “You’re a nut if you believe that, Marcus.”
345. Unknown: “Why would any woman give her life willingly?”
346. Unknown: “To save her village mostly,”
347. Unknown: “There were some who came to me for other reasons.”
348. Unknown: “Depraved ones, I’m sure.”
349. Unknown: “I take insult to that, Samantha.”
350. Unknown: “Oh, God, let me wake up. This can’t be real.”
351. Unknown: “You need to go back to wherever it is you came from.”
352. Unknown: “I cannot,”
353. Unknown: “I told you, the Council—”
354. Unknown: “I mean back to wherever you were a few days ago.”
355. Unknown: “I cannot do that either, Sam.”
356. Unknown: “Why not?”
357. Unknown: “If you’re planning on having sex with me, you can forget it.”
358. Unknown: “Can Eric forget it as well?”
359. Unknown: “How dare you ask me that? Who do you think you are, anyway?”
360. Unknown: “You scare me to death after you destroy my stable, then you come drifting back here like you own the place, and me with it! What I do with Eric is my business!”
361. Unknown: “Got that? I must be insane to let you stay here!”
362. Unknown: “Damn it, woman, you smell good.”
363. Unknown: “Out!”
364. Unknown: “I like when you blush, but I like it even more when you push up this lip,”
365. Unknown: “ready to fight.”
366. Unknown: “Make yourself useful if you want to stay here. There’s plenty to do.”
367. Unknown: “Does this mean you want me to stay, Sam?”
368. Unknown: “That was a cruel thing to say, Sam. I would not have expected it from you.”
369. Unknown: “You don’t even know me.”
370. Unknown: “Tell them to me.”
371. Unknown: “You already know them,”
372. Unknown: “No, some you keep hidden too deep for even me to see.”
373. Unknown: “I’ll tell you and then will you leave me alone?”
374. Unknown: “It’s simple,”
375. Unknown: “I want someone who’s going to stick around. And he isn’t you.”
376. Unknown: “Can a man do this?”
377. Unknown: “Don’t be afraid,”
378. Unknown: “I’ve got you.”
379. Unknown: “Marcus, please…”
380. Unknown: “Relax, Sam. I’m not putting you down.”
381. Unknown: “Every time we speak, you run from me.”
382. Unknown: “Stop sniveling, Sam. Never have I met a woman so determined to pretend I am not what I say.”
383. Unknown: “Enjoy the ride,”
384. Unknown: “Not many humans experience England from this viewpoint.”
385. Unknown: “Yes, they do! Only they do it from the safety of a plane!”
386. Unknown: “And what is a plane but a thoughtless metal beast with wings? Why, I’ve knocked a few of them out of the air as if they were made of mist. I tell you. I am safer.”
387. Unknown: “God, help me,”
388. Unknown: “Now we shall speak with no more running.”
389. Unknown: “I swear I won’t be as easy as your other victims,”
390. Unknown: “You’ve already proven that,”
391. Unknown: “I have no intention of hurting you, Sam. When will you understand that?”
392. Unknown: “Maybe when you stop scaring the hell out of me?”
393. Unknown: “You frighten easily.”
394. Unknown: “What do you want from me?”
395. Unknown: “I just want to talk.”
396. Unknown: “Fine. Then talk.”
397. Unknown: “Are you this cold to Eric?”
398. Unknown: “I don’t want to talk about him.”
399. Unknown: “Is it just me you’re afraid of?”
400. Unknown: “Or is it all males?”
401. Unknown: “Why on earth would I be afraid of men, Marcus?”
402. Unknown: “Because they have torn away at your hopes of ever having what your heart truly desires.”
403. Unknown: “If you know that already, why are you wasting my time here?”
404. Unknown: “I want to understand this quest of yours, Sam. I’m not familiar with your human emotions. What is so extraordinary about this love for which you are saving yourself?”
405. Unknown: “I don’t know.”
406. Unknown: “Neither do I. Mayhap,”
407. Unknown: “It is not so extraordinary at all.”
408. Unknown: “It is,”
409. Unknown: “It is.”
410. Unknown: “When I write it, it is.”
411. Unknown: “Ah, you want a man like your Sir Robert then?”
412. Unknown: “Someone like him, yes,”
413. Unknown: “I am not a knight, Sam.”
414. Unknown: “I know.”
415. Unknown: “Look. We clearly want different things,”
416. Unknown: “You want sex, and I want a man who can make a commitment to me and keep it. We have nothing in common, so why don’t you just return me back to my ordinary life and fly off into the sunset?”
417. Unknown: “How can you be so satisfied with ordinary? Do you truly want to live out your life with a mundane creature like Eric in a run-down pile of stones that vex your every waking moment?”
418. Unknown: “My pile of stones is a home, Marcus. It’s mine and it’s permanent. Something I’ve never really had before. And Eric seems dependable enough.”
419. Unknown: “Enough for what?”
420. Unknown: “To bore you to tears? You could not even stand to spend an afternoon with him once you met me.”
421. Unknown: “My goodness, you’re conceited.”
422. Unknown: “Why do you resist me when I can offer you so much more than any man ever could?”
423. Unknown: “What makes you think I want what you offer?”
424. Unknown: “The moment you had me, you would become a memory even worse than Raymond.”
425. Unknown: “Stop running from me, Sam.”
426. Unknown: “No,”
427. Unknown: “Please, stop.”
428. Unknown: “You aren’t human. You don’t love, and I want love.”
429. Unknown: “Mask that damnable scent of yours, Virgin. Or next time I will ravage you beyond your comprehension.”
430. Unknown: “The moment you had me, you would become a memory even worse than Raymond.”
431. Unknown: “Tabitha?”
432. Unknown: “Please keep him in the playroom.”
433. Unknown: “Garion,”
434. Unknown: “Come in here and speak to me please.”
435. Unknown: “Come here, son.”
436. Unknown: “I thought we agreed,”
437. Unknown: “that you would only fly in the playroom.”
438. Unknown: “I want to fly outside.”
439. Unknown: “Soon, Garion. As soon as it’s safe.”
440. Unknown: “What’s come over you, Ellie?”
441. Unknown: “I thought you would be happy that I’ve found someone to care for me.”
442. Unknown: “Are you happy?”
443. Unknown: “Well, are you?”
444. Unknown: “Yes!”
445. Unknown: “Oh, pah!”
446. Unknown: “How can you be happy with a man who can put you into a mild coma the moment he opens his mouth? He has the intelligence of a worm.”
447. Unknown: “Marcus had some life to him, at least,”
448. Unknown: “I think he would come back if he thought you wanted him to.”
449. Unknown: “Do you?”
450. Unknown: “I do. And the battlement walls still need fixing, as well as the drawbridge, and don’t forget the roof.”
451. Unknown: “Eric has offered to hire men to finish the drawbridge.”
452. Unknown: “That’s good of Eric, dear,”
453. Unknown: “Yes, it is,”
454. Unknown: “He’s also asked me to go to London with him next week for a conference. I was reluctant because he only booked one hotel room, but…”
455. Unknown: “…I’m not getting any younger, you know.”
456. Unknown: “Where is he?”
457. Unknown: “Who, dear?”
458. Unknown: “Oh, don’t give me that, Ellie. You know perfectly well who. He’s talking to you right now, isn’t he?”
459. Unknown: “I don’t know what—”
460. Unknown: “Marcus!”
461. Unknown: “If you have something to say, say it to me and stop yelling in Ellie’s head, you coward!”
462. Unknown: “Oh, I’m quite used to it by now,”
463. Unknown: “Fine then,”
464. Unknown: “Tell him that after next week there won’t be any reason for him to ever come back. I’ll fix the damn battlements myself!”
465. Unknown: “Sam, don’t be angry with him. You’ve no idea…”
466. Unknown: “Sam?”
467. Unknown: “Ellie, let me in on her way out,”
468. Unknown: “She said you were up here searching for dragons.”
469. Unknown: “You’ve no need to fear dragons, my darling, for your knight has arrived.”
470. Unknown: “What on earth are you still doing in your pajamas?”
471. Unknown: “It’s freezing.”
472. Unknown: “Just thinking.”
473. Unknown: “You’re flushed. You’ll catch your death.”
474. Unknown: “Well, I…”
475. Unknown: “Eric, you’re right, it’s cold and windy up here.”
476. Unknown: “Maybe we should go inside. I’ll make us some tea.”
477. Unknown: “Brilliant,”
478. Unknown: “I could use a cup after the wretched morning I had on the phone with the mother of one of my patients. She insisted I prescribe something for little Stanley who’d come down with food poisoning…”
479. Unknown: “What’s wrong?”
480. Unknown: “Food poisoning?”
481. Unknown: “Poor Stanley. Eric, go on down. I’ll be there in a moment.”
482. Unknown: “Sam, I don’t think you’re well. You’ve looked dreadful for weeks.”
483. Unknown: “I’m fine, Eric, really. There’s something I forgot to do. Please, go on. I’ll be down shortly.”
484. Unknown: “All right,”
485. Unknown: “But don’t be long. I’ll start the tea.”
486. Unknown: “Thank you.”
487. Unknown: “You’ll fall, Marcus,”
488. Unknown: “I like your concern for me.”
489. Unknown: “Did you miss me, Sam?”
490. Unknown: “How many of us have you deflowered since you left?”
491. Unknown: “There are very few of you left. And I believe I have found the diamond.”
492. Unknown: “Why did you come back?”
493. Unknown: “You know perfectly well why, Sam,”
494. Unknown: “I cannot let you go off alone with that worm.”
495. Unknown: “Then you were listening.”
496. Unknown: “Ellie is my friend, Marcus. You used her to get to me.”
497. Unknown: “She was willing to help me.”
498. Unknown: “Sure, because she has no idea what you really want to do to me.”
499. Unknown: “And what is so terrible about that?”
500. Unknown: “I want something more.”
501. Unknown: “I don’t know if I have more to give.”
502. Unknown: “Drakkons are ancient beings with eons of knowledge and centuries of experience. But everything I know is meaningless as a man.”
503. Unknown: “Ellie has been trying to help me.”
504. Unknown: “Help you what?”
505. Unknown: “Be better at this, though she insists that I’m as good as it gets. I figure if I’m stuck like this for a while, I might as well do it right. I should have been hunting someone who can help me regain what I lost, but instead, I spent my time with Ellie.”
506. Unknown: “She has been dragging me to a dozen shops,”
507. Unknown: “I find today’s fashion miserably confining.”
508. Unknown: “But,”
509. Unknown: “she insists that you will grow weary of seeing me in the same garments day-after-day.”
510. Unknown: “How did you pay for new clothes?”
511. Unknown: “I sold my Rolex,”
512. Unknown: “As it turns out, the watch was worth more than I thought. I was able to buy everything I’ll need to fix this place up, including your drawbridge.”
513. Unknown: “Ellie has also been reading your story of Sir Tristan to me,”
514. Unknown: “and while I find your affinity toward knights rather irritating,”
515. Unknown: “I think I now have a better understanding of what you desire in a companion.”
516. Unknown: “Do you?”
517. Unknown: “Send Eric away.”
518. Unknown: “And let me show you what I have learned, Sam.”
519. Unknown: “I’ll be right back,”
520. Unknown: “Marcus?”
521. Unknown: “All your talk of retching gave me an idea,”
522. Unknown: “Eric has a queasy stomach and the moment I told him that I felt sick enough to hurl all over his five-hundred-dollar leather boots, he bade me farewell and made a hasty departure.”
523. Unknown: “Well done,”
524. Unknown: “The worm was correct about one thing,”
525. Unknown: “Your skin feels like ice.”
526. Unknown: “I’ll feed the hearth fire.”
527. Unknown: “Didn’t you know winter was coming? You have one log, Sam.”
528. Unknown: “It’s a good thing I came back. It’s obvious how much I am needed here.”
529. Unknown: “I was going to…”
530. Unknown: “Can you still do it?”
531. Unknown: “Do what?”
532. Unknown: “Breathe fire?”
533. Unknown: “No, Sam, I cannot.”
534. Unknown: “Do you wish you could?”
535. Unknown: “You love to write, don’t you?”
536. Unknown: “Yes.”
537. Unknown: “If you woke up one morning and you could never write again, would you wish you could? Would you miss telling your stories?”
538. Unknown: “Yes, I would miss it very much, Marcus,”
539. Unknown: “You have no reason to fear me. I’ll prove to you that I’m not a monster.”
540. Unknown: “Nay, ssh,”
541. Unknown: “Stop thinking.”
542. Unknown: “I’ve missed you,”
543. Unknown: “I’ve missed you, too.”
544. Unknown: “I’m glad.”
545. Unknown: “I like the part where Patrice throws a rock at Tristan’s head and then realizes that he loves her. Read it to me.”
546. Unknown: “You want me to read my book to you?”
547. Unknown: “Aye.”
548. Unknown: “Patrice’s laughter faded gazing up into the cool, beautiful eyes of the only man she had ever loved. He took her breath away. He was staring at her the way he used to, as if his very life depended on drinking in the sight of her face. There was no lust in the eyes that swept over her features, but a hunger, a longing need for something neither of them understood.”
549. Unknown: “That is a pivotal scene for them. They began to trust each other after that.”
550. Unknown: “I know.”
551. Unknown: “Why did you leave?”
552. Unknown: “I thought you weren’t coming back.”
553. Unknown: “I was angry.”
554. Unknown: “And conflicted.”
555. Unknown: “I thought a lot about being a man and being a Drakkon. And I thought about you.”
556. Unknown: “I’m glad you came back.”
557. Unknown: “What?”
558. Unknown: “What?”
559. Unknown: “Are you trying to behave like Tristan?”
560. Unknown: “Absolutely not!”
561. Unknown: “It’s very endearing.”
562. Unknown: “It is?”
563. Unknown: “Yes, but I’ll help.”
564. Unknown: “I like the romantic Marcus.”
565. Unknown: “I hate his guts.”
566. Unknown: “I need to rebuild a wall or something.”
567. Unknown: “I’m sorry,”
568. Unknown: “You kiss extremely well if it’s any consolation.”
569. Unknown: “It is,”
570. Unknown: “Up until a few months ago, I didn’t even have lips.”
571. Unknown: “You know,”
572. Unknown: “It’s about fifty-five degrees outside and you’re wearing shorts. I think you’re nuts.”
573. Unknown: “I have cold blood.”
574. Unknown: “I’ve noticed,”
575. Unknown: “Are you hungry?”
576. Unknown: “Starving.”
577. Unknown: “Good.”
578. Unknown: “I’m going to make you a nice dinner tonight. Ellie’s not the only one who can cook around here.”
579. Unknown: “What did I do to deserve this?”
580. Unknown: “You have nice legs.”
581. Unknown: “Tomorrow I will show you my feet and maybe I can work another kiss out of you.”
582. Unknown: “They are quite remarkable you know.”
583. Unknown: “I never thought they could hold me up and I’m quite proud of them for it.”
584. Unknown: “I’m sure they’re wonderfully strong feet.”
585. Unknown: “You’re not afraid of me anymore then?”
586. Unknown: “Should I be?”
587. Unknown: “Nay, you shouldn’t.”
588. Unknown: “I will take nothing from you that you do not want to give.”
589. Unknown: “The sight of you—the scent of you is driving me mad, Sam. Shall I beg you for a kiss the way Sir Tristan did with Lady Patrice?”
590. Unknown: “Marcus,”
591. Unknown: “I’m going to work on the drawbridge. The wood arrived while you were gone,”
592. Unknown: “Marcus?”
593. Unknown: “I’ll go check on the roast.”
594. Unknown: “Sam, I—”
595. Unknown: “Saint George’s guts, what the hell is that smell?”
596. Unknown: “You seem to have bathed in something foul.”
597. Unknown: “It’s onion. Don’t you think it’s a wonderful idea?”
598. Unknown: “Not unless you plan on serving yourself for dinner.”
599. Unknown: “Oh, don’t be silly.”
600. Unknown: “I’m simply masking that smell you say drives you mad.”
601. Unknown: “Well, go wash it off. I don’t like it.”
602. Unknown: “No.”
603. Unknown: “I did this for you.”
604. Unknown: “I find your consideration for me quite… By the stars, you smell repulsive!”
605. Unknown: “Go wash up, Marcus,”
606. Unknown: “You don’t smell so great yourself.”
607. Unknown: “Oh,”
608. Unknown: “I picked up a shirt for you today at a wonderful little vintage shop. I think it will fit you better than the newer fashions you find so confining.”
609. Unknown: “Aye, Sam.”
610. Unknown: “Nice feet. You were right.”
611. Unknown: “Thank you.”
612. Unknown: “It looks wonderful in here, Sam.”
613. Unknown: “I’m glad you like it.”
614. Unknown: “Thank you for the shirt.”
615. Unknown: “I look just like a knight taking a break from hunting Drakkons.”
616. Unknown: “Marcus—”
617. Unknown: “I appreciate the things you do for me, Sam. No one has ever done them before. I’m sorry if I was cruel.”
618. Unknown: “The shirt fits me well. It’s quite comfortable and roomy.”
619. Unknown: “I wasn’t thinking, Marcus.”
620. Unknown: “Shh,”
621. Unknown: “Now I understand why that keeps vampires away.”
622. Unknown: “That’s garlic, silly.”
623. Unknown: “Garlic…onions… they are both equally vile.”
624. Unknown: “Are they real?”
625. Unknown: “Vampires?”
626. Unknown: “I don’t doubt much anymore.”
627. Unknown: “In a way, they are. But that is a long story and one you most likely would not enjoy.”
628. Unknown: “Now you’re being considerate.”
629. Unknown: “Didn’t you ever eat cooked meat when you were a Drakkon?”
630. Unknown: “Nay,”
631. Unknown: “There wasn’t time to char my food before I ate it, especially in the last several centuries. Knights hunted us day and night, and after them there were always others. We stayed out of sight mostly, but mankind is afraid of what they do not understand.”
632. Unknown: “What about after you became a man? You never stopped into a Mickey D’s for a burger?”
633. Unknown: “Mickey D’s burgers are meat, Sam?”
634. Unknown: “We’re not truly immortal. We simply age at a much slower rate than humans—a few hundred years slower.”
635. Unknown: “How old are you, then?”
636. Unknown: “I was born in the eleventh century.”
637. Unknown: “How do you do that?”
638. Unknown: “Make your lips tighter and blow.”
639. Unknown: “So, if you remain a man,”
640. Unknown: “You’ll grow old like me?”
641. Unknown: “Nay, the Phoenix Amber can only alter our form. My blood is still Drakkon blood.”
642. Unknown: “I see,”
643. Unknown: “Then you will always desire a virgin—any virgin?”
644. Unknown: “Probably, if she is of an accountable age,”
645. Unknown: “It would pain you if I desired another woman, Sam?”
646. Unknown: “Of course, not!”
647. Unknown: “We haven’t made any promises to each other. You can do what you want.”
648. Unknown: “What is it about virgins, anyway?”
649. Unknown: “Are we trophies? Is that it?”
650. Unknown: “I’m not sure what trophies are.”
651. Unknown: “I do not know any more if it was even worth eat—”
652. Unknown: “—taking their essence.”
653. Unknown: “What do you mean?”
654. Unknown: “The Drakkon are superior over all other creatures, but we lack purity. Maybe we are born with it and we lose it over the centuries.”
655. Unknown: “After living for a thousand years, very little remains fresh and new. You cease to see the good in things around you. Cynicism and caution become your only friends. But there is always that desire for innocence eating away at your heart, yearning to be born anew, to capture that one thing you do not possess, the thing none of us truly understands.”
656. Unknown: “And you think you can find it in a virgin?”
657. Unknown: “A virgin has never been soiled by another. Their blood is pure.”
658. Unknown: “But that doesn’t necessarily mean their hearts are.”
659. Unknown: “Marcus, I’m a virgin and I look at the world through cynical eyes too. I was an orphan. I spent my life either alone or with people who really didn’t care one way or the other about me. If I was fortunate enough to find foster parents who did care for me, it was never permanent. I don’t have what you need.”
660. Unknown: “Perhaps then, Sam,”
661. Unknown: “we are both looking for the same thing.”
662. Unknown: “Perhaps we are.”
663. Unknown: “Marcus?”
664. Unknown: “Aye?”
665. Unknown: “What was the terrible disease set forth by the Gold Drakkon’s crime?”
666. Unknown: “It was the birth of Mankind.”
667. Unknown: “The disease was man.”
668. Unknown: “I don’t believe that, Marcus. God created man. We’re not a disease.”
669. Unknown: “Perhaps not.”
670. Unknown: “But if they are, then you are the cure born to right the wrong.”
671. Unknown: “Marcus, what are you doing?”
672. Unknown: “Sam, not so loud, I beg you,”
673. Unknown: “Oh,”
674. Unknown: “You have a hangover.”
675. Unknown: “I’m dying, Samantha.”
676. Unknown: “You’re not dying.”
677. Unknown: “Had you ever drunk wine before last night, Marcus?”
678. Unknown: “Come on,”
679. Unknown: “You need some coffee.”
680. Unknown: “Or is it a bloody Mary? I can’t remember what the cure is for a hangover.”
681. Unknown: “That was a tasteless joke, Sam.”
682. Unknown: “It’s a tomato concoction, silly.”
683. Unknown: “Please don’t throw up in my bed.”
684. Unknown: “Fear not, I thought some fresh air would help so I went flying. I think I threw up on your Eric or near him. My aim was poor.”
685. Unknown: “Hell, I hate those damn things,”
686. Unknown: “Phones?”
687. Unknown: “It’s Ellie.”
688. Unknown: “Ellie?”
689. Unknown: “Marcus,”
690. Unknown: “Yes, he came back yesterday.”
691. Unknown: “She wants to speak to you.”
692. Unknown: “Amanda had one of these cursed things. It screeched at the most ill-timed moments.”
693. Unknown: “Amanda?”
694. Unknown: “Padgora’s wife,”
695. Unknown: “I see,”
696. Unknown: “Put it to your ear and say hello, Marcus.”
697. Unknown: “Hello?”
698. Unknown: “Where are you, Ellie?”
699. Unknown: “Yes, Ellie, I’m glad I came back, too.”
700. Unknown: “Marcus, what is it?”
701. Unknown: “Telepathy…don’t use it.”
702. Unknown: “She’s coming over. She knows what to do.”
703. Unknown: “Good,”
704. Unknown: “Then mayhap you’ll cease trying to kill me.”
705. Unknown: “You know what? Fix your own damn coffee. Or better yet, why don’t you call Amanda and have her come over and do it?”
706. Unknown: “It’s you!”
707. Unknown: “Where is she? Where’s Sam?”
708. Unknown: “I have a hangover,”
709. Unknown: “If you make another sound, I will throw you into the fire where you belong.”
710. Unknown: “I’m calling the authorities!”
711. Unknown: “What have you done to Sam?”
712. Unknown: “Damn it!”
713. Unknown: “Marcus, stop it!”
714. Unknown: “Move aside, Sam.”
715. Unknown: “I will not!”
716. Unknown: “You let him go, Marcus. Right now!”
717. Unknown: “You would save this worm?”
718. Unknown: “Yes, I would.”
719. Unknown: “Very well, Sam,”
720. Unknown: “Keep him then.”
721. Unknown: “Sam!”
722. Unknown: “He’s a madman. He attacked me for no reason!”
723. Unknown: “I’m sorry. He doesn’t seem to like you, but I don’t think he—”
724. Unknown: “Who the hell is he anyway?”
725. Unknown: “And why is he here at eight o’clock in the morning wearing nothing but skivvies? Are you having sex with him, Samantha?”
726. Unknown: “She’s a virgin, you maggot.”
727. Unknown: “Can’t you smell it?”
728. Unknown: “Bastard,”
729. Unknown: “You’re just going to let him sit there? Call the authorities, Sam!”
730. Unknown: “Eric, he’s a friend of mine.”
731. Unknown: “Oh, so now he’s a friend. You told me you hired him to repair your wall.”
732. Unknown: “I did.”
733. Unknown: “I think,”
734. Unknown: “You and this…this…”
735. Unknown: “Drakkon,”
736. Unknown: “What?”
737. Unknown: “Aha, so you’re a foreigner, that explains it.”
738. Unknown: “Eric,”
739. Unknown: “What are you doing here anyway?”
740. Unknown: “I came over to check on you since you said you were ill yesterday.”
741. Unknown: “She’s fine now,”
742. Unknown: “So, you can leave.”
743. Unknown: “I haven’t eaten breakfast yet. Take me somewhere, will you? We can talk there.”
744. Unknown: “What’s that smell?”
745. Unknown: “Let me get my coat.”
746. Unknown: “Don’t leave this house with him, Sam,”
747. Unknown: “Or what?”
748. Unknown: “You’ll leave again?”
749. Unknown: “No, but I…”
750. Unknown: “Give me my coat,”
751. Unknown: “Very well, then. Farewell.”
752. Unknown: “Come on.”
753. Unknown: “I see Marcus chopped some more wood.”
754. Unknown: “I was sure he would have left,”
755. Unknown: “No, dear. He’s still here. He was in a foul mood though.”
756. Unknown: “Humph,”
757. Unknown: “Oh, wonderful.”
758. Unknown: “I see Marcus is not the only one who’s in a foul mood today. Care to tell me what happened?”
759. Unknown: “You mean he didn’t tell you?”
760. Unknown: “He just said he had a terrible hangover from some drink you tried to poison him with last evening. And then he told me you went out with Eric, which I assumed was the real reason he was stomping about, cursing the walls.”
761. Unknown: “I tried to poison him?”
762. Unknown: “I cooked him a fine dinner last night, Ellie. How was I supposed to know he couldn’t hold his alcohol?”
763. Unknown: “According to this, alcohol is poisonous to Drakkons, dear. He could have died.”
764. Unknown: “You mean really poisonous?”
765. Unknown: “Is he okay?”
766. Unknown: “Where is he? Oh, Ellie, I didn’t know. If I did anything to hurt him I’d never forgive myself.”
767. Unknown: “He’s fine, dear.”
768. Unknown: “I made him a brew of some thyme, thistle, and cranberry juice, if you can believe that. It actually helped him. He’s sleeping now.”
769. Unknown: “How did you know what to make him?”
770. Unknown: “He told me,”
771. Unknown: “When I advised him that wine was an alcoholic drink, he knew what he needed to be well.”
772. Unknown: “He had no idea what a hangover was. He just assumed it meant an ill feeling that causes your head to hang over.”
773. Unknown: “Oh, Ellie, I had no idea.”
774. Unknown: “Sam, dear, you must realize that Marcus has never experienced some of the things we take for granted. He has this ancient knowledge coursing through his blood about the earth and the elements, and yet he’s as innocent as a babe when it comes to things men his human age should know.”
775. Unknown: “Oh, that’s all basic instinct, dear.”
776. Unknown: “Any red-blooded male knows instinctively what to do with his…well…what God has endowed him with.”
777. Unknown: “He didn’t…we didn’t…”
778. Unknown: “Of course you didn’t, my dear.”
779. Unknown: “Part of his ranting this morning had to do with you rubbing yourself down in bleeping, flipping onions so that you wouldn’t drive him mad, but you were driving him mad just the same.”
780. Unknown: “Oh, for goodness sakes, Ellie!”
781. Unknown: “What else did he tell you?”
782. Unknown: “That’s it,”
783. Unknown: “Where did you get the book?”
784. Unknown: “Marcus gave it to me.”
785. Unknown: “What does it say?”
786. Unknown: “Well, according to this, the Drakkon have survived for thousands of years. They are a solitary race sharing some of the same emotions we feel, save passion, jealousy, sorrow, things like that.”
787. Unknown: “Like any beast,”
788. Unknown: “they mate mainly to procreate. But they do love their life-mate, only I don’t think Marcus has ever loved anyone before. They also experience anger. That emotion he knows well,”
789. Unknown: “They lived in cliffs and caves. Some, like Marcus, lived around seas and some dwelled in mountains or in forests. They have, or had, a second stomach that turned what they digested into acid and in turn the acid would change into in byproduct of hydrogen and something or other. The book says there were many different species of the Drakkon, and many had their own color. Marcus was an Aqua, Sam.”
790. Unknown: “The Aqua were among the first to inhabit the earth sometime around 16BC. They were a proud and mighty lot, unlike the Greens, their distant cousins, who were friend to any species in power at any given time. Or the Reds, who were a warrior genus. And then there are the Whites, who lived mostly in Scotland. They were the priests if you will, or peacemakers among all the classes. Marcus warred with them for many years.”
791. Unknown: “Marcus is mentioned in that book?”
792. Unknown: “Yes, apparently, this book was written by a White who transformed, as they call it.”
793. Unknown: “What does it say?”
794. Unknown: “Well,”
795. Unknown: “I’m sure whoever wrote this was quite biased against our Marcus, but it says that he was a renegade Drakkon, hunted by other transformed Drakkon for many years. The poor boy is not even aware that some of the knights who hunted him were transformed Reds and Greens.”
796. Unknown: “He cannot read our language, hence he has never read this book.”
797. Unknown: “Anyway, it says here… ‘Marrkiya of the Eleventh,’ called so because of the century he was born in, turned against mankind and Drakkon alike, and was hunted, but neither man nor any other could stop him. His strength and power went unmatched throughout time, and as of this writing, there has yet to be a Drakkon strong enough to conquer him.”
798. Unknown: “Here is the bad part, Sam. It says that evil drove him to madness. A destroyer of cities, he ravaged men, women, and children alike with the mighty fire in a delusional plot to vanquish mankind. Marrkiya the Aqua, it says, does love no soul either living or dead, not even his own, but curses all to ashes.”
799. Unknown: “You know it’s not true, dear. This was written by his enemy.”
800. Unknown: “But why?”
801. Unknown: “Why would they say such terrible things about him?”
802. Unknown: “Because he fought the change, Samantha. He didn’t agree that transformation was the only answer that would keep the Drakkon alive. At first, he wanted to fight, but then it says he did try to go before the Council with requests to speak with Sir George of the High Order of Knights. The Whites refused, but Marcus tried anyway. Sir George shot him with a golden arrow, the only thing that can kill a full-blooded Drakkon and left Marrkiya to die. But Marrkiya was rescued, carried to a forgotten part of the world, according to this author, and when he returned a century later and stronger, he made war with man. His race turned against him and he fought alone.”
803. Unknown: “It doesn’t say. But the Whites are all afraid of him. This author, Patrick White he is called, says that ‘as of the writing of this book, we endeavor to find Marrkiya and transform him ourselves.’”
804. Unknown: “They found him and did it, Ellie,”
805. Unknown: “Yes, dear, they did.”
806. Unknown: “There’s a painting of him in this book. Would you like to see it?”
807. Unknown: “Page four hundred and sixty-three,”
808. Unknown: “He looks so sad, Ellie.”
809. Unknown: “I know.”
810. Unknown: “I’m going to go check on him and then make us some tea.”
811. Unknown: “Forgive me for poisoning you. I didn’t know.”
812. Unknown: “I know.”
813. Unknown: “Forgive me for being a monster.”
814. Unknown: “I felt you missing me,”
815. Unknown: “I liked it. Do it again.”
816. Unknown: “You would have to go away for me to miss you.”
817. Unknown: “Maybe I shall go away then.”
818. Unknown: “I’ll never forgive you if you do.”
819. Unknown: “It’s Ellie,”
820. Unknown: “She worries over us. I just told her we’d be down in a moment.”
821. Unknown: “I saw the book you gave her,”
822. Unknown: “Who is the author, Patrick White? Do you know him?”
823. Unknown: “He is Padgora, the one who altered me. Our names are changed after we are transformed.”
824. Unknown: “The Padgora whose wife you slept with?”
825. Unknown: “Don’t be ridiculous!”
826. Unknown: “It is the same way I feel about Eric, nay?”
827. Unknown: “Maybe, but I didn’t give myself to Eric.”
828. Unknown: “I didn’t give myself to Amanda either.”
829. Unknown: “But you slept…you made love to her.”
830. Unknown: “It wasn’t love. It was revenge.”
831. Unknown: “Revenge is wrong, Marcus. And it doesn’t matter why you took her to bed. I still don’t like it.”
832. Unknown: “Then I vow never to take another woman to bed, save you.”
833. Unknown: “I think I’ll go to town tomorrow,”
834. Unknown: “I need a new toaster.”
835. Unknown: “I’ll escort you,”
836. Unknown: “Last time we shopped there, it seemed a bit raucous.”
837. Unknown: “My dear, it was raucous because of you. Why, there had to be a dozen women following us from store-to-store, and we gathered more as we went.”
838. Unknown: “Me?”
839. Unknown: “What did I do?”
840. Unknown: “You don’t look like other men, dear.”
841. Unknown: “You look less…tamed. Women like big and you’ve got that in the bag.”
842. Unknown: “I don’t even have a bag.”
843. Unknown: “How much longer will you be staying?”
844. Unknown: “As long as I’m needed.”
845. Unknown: “Let me clean up, Ellie,”
846. Unknown: “You go rest with your book.”
847. Unknown: “I’ll help.”
848. Unknown: “Meet me in the bailey in five minutes,”
849. Unknown: “What for?”
850. Unknown: “Fly with me, Sam. Why are you afraid?”
851. Unknown: “You know I won’t let you fall.”
852. Unknown: “Did you miss me again, Sam?”
853. Unknown: “I like kissing you,”
854. Unknown: “I like kissing you, too,”
855. Unknown: “Fly with me.”
856. Unknown: “I won’t let you go, Samantha.”
857. Unknown: “Wrap your legs around mine.”
858. Unknown: “Marcus?”
859. Unknown: “Where is that music coming from?”
860. Unknown: “It’s hard to breathe, Marcus.”
861. Unknown: “What’s wrong?”
862. Unknown: “What is this you’re feeling for me, Sam? I don’t understand it.”
863. Unknown: “Marcus, I’m falling in love with you.”
864. Unknown: “Why is it hurting you?”
865. Unknown: “It’s not hurting me,”
866. Unknown: “Love is sacrificial. And sometimes that means giving up things you’re afraid of. I’m afraid to love you.”
867. Unknown: “I’m not going to leave you, Sam,”
868. Unknown: “Do you promise?”
869. Unknown: “Aye, I promise.”
870. Unknown: “Aren’t you cold?”
871. Unknown: “Are you?”
872. Unknown: “Do you want to go back?”
873. Unknown: “No,”
874. Unknown: “I want to give myself to you, Marcus,”
875. Unknown: “Take me, Marcus.”
876. Unknown: “I won’t hurt you,”
877. Unknown: “No.”
878. Unknown: “I would taste a pearl of your passion before I take it.”
879. Unknown: “It’s a treasure I’ll cherish for all eternity.”
880. Unknown: “Don’t be frightened,”
881. Unknown: “No…nay, my sweet. Relax with me.”
882. Unknown: “Marcus,”
883. Unknown: “My treasure.”
884. Unknown: “What are you thinking about?”
885. Unknown: “I’m thinking that perhaps I’m falling in love with you, as well.”
886. Unknown: “Really?”
887. Unknown: “Really.”
888. Unknown: “I came by to see if you were back and found him lurking around,”
889. Unknown: “I knew he was one of them by all that snowy white hair and those silver eyes. They just don’t look like mortal men, do they?”
890. Unknown: “Who is he and what does he want?”
891. Unknown: “Said his name was Thomas White, distant relation to Patrick White, the author of that book. I told him I knew what he was and he smiled and nearly knocked my knickers off. Said he needed to see Marcus and that he and Marcus went way back.”
892. Unknown: “I’m sure they do.”
893. Unknown: “This must be Samantha.”
894. Unknown: “She is mine, Thomas.”
895. Unknown: “I can tell that,”
896. Unknown: “You’ve made the lady blush, Marcus.”
897. Unknown: “Worry not,”
898. Unknown: “His temper will fade with time.”
899. Unknown: “Let’s discuss how you wake up sweating every night because of dreams of an Aqua Drakkon who still considers charring your friends to cinders and making you his next meal.”
900. Unknown: “WELL, THOMAS,”
901. Unknown: “What’s so urgent you came to my dwelling to tell me?”
902. Unknown: “May I speak freely in front of these ladies?”
903. Unknown: “Get on with it, Thomas. I don’t need to be Drakkon to kill you.”
904. Unknown: “How are you, Marcus? We’ve expected to hear more from you.”
905. Unknown: “I’ve been busy. Get to your damned point.”
906. Unknown: “You took a few things from Padgora.”
907. Unknown: “And?”
908. Unknown: “And he wants them back.”
909. Unknown: “Don’t speak to me of what’s acceptable. You destroyed the last living Drakkon against his will.”
910. Unknown: “I have things to show you,”
911. Unknown: “You’re not the cold monster Padgora claims you to be.”
912. Unknown: “And how do you know that?”
913. Unknown: “Fra taya lepodos existia.”
914. Unknown: “I grew to love you as a brother, Marrkiya, in those days of sunlight and hours spent listening to your deepest desires, in those days before hatred consumed you.”
915. Unknown: “You?”
916. Unknown: “Why don’t I remember you there?”
917. Unknown: “I made you forget.”
918. Unknown: “Why?”
919. Unknown: “I wasn’t supposed to help you, Marcus.”
920. Unknown: “You knew what the Drakkon meant to me.”
921. Unknown: “Yes, I knew.”
922. Unknown: “And that’s why I’m here now. No one loves our race the way you do. Patrick and the others have wanted you dead for so long. When they discovered your lair ten years ago, it was I who kept them from killing you.”
923. Unknown: “Thomas, you saved me once, long ago, and you have my gratitude for that, but you also had a part in destroying the Drakkon so I—”
924. Unknown: “Who is she?”
925. Unknown: “You will see,”
926. Unknown: “Tabitha.”
927. Unknown: “This is Marcus.”
928. Unknown: “Hello, Marcus,”
929. Unknown: “I never thought I would meet another Aqua,”
930. Unknown: “My father was one, but he died when I was born.”
931. Unknown: “Why would you bring her to me? I don’t want her.”
932. Unknown: “I know. I brought her here because I heard the music two days ago. Others may have, as well. I knew now was the right time. Tabitha would be safe around you. But it isn’t her who I bring to you, Marcus. It’s him. This is Garion. He is an orphan.”
933. Unknown: “Say hello to Marcus, Garion.”
934. Unknown: “Thomas?”
935. Unknown: “Yes, he is Drakkon, Marcus. A Gold. The first one we’ve seen in six hundred years.”
936. Unknown: “I can fly. Wanna’ see?”
937. Unknown: “I thought I was the last.”
938. Unknown: “You were.”
939. Unknown: “But if he can fly, then that means he’s only recently been transformed.”
940. Unknown: “Would you like some help?”
941. Unknown: “I can do it.”
942. Unknown: “He’s quite independent,”
943. Unknown: “When did the Whites transform him?”
944. Unknown: “We didn’t.”
945. Unknown: “What’s he doing?”
946. Unknown: “Just watch,”
947. Unknown: “Watch what…”
948. Unknown: “Marcus.”
949. Unknown: “He’s a dragon. A real dragon.”
950. Unknown: “How is this possible, Thomas?”
951. Unknown: “I don’t know. Patrick has known about him for a very long time. He’s been searching, and when he couldn’t find him, he assumed you had found the egg first and hid it with your hoard. But I found it three years ago, in the jungles of Madagascar. I’ve been hiding him since he hatched. It’s been painstaking keeping my thoughts of him from the others. He can transform back and forth without the aid of any amber. We can discuss all the possibilities later. For now, all I need to know is if the boy and Tabitha can stay here with you?”
952. Unknown: “Me?”
953. Unknown: “Why me?”
954. Unknown: “Because someone needs to protect him. Someone strong—with wings.”
955. Unknown: “You knew I would say aye, Thomas. But I could have done better protecting him as Drakkon.”
956. Unknown: “Perhaps,”
957. Unknown: “But you wouldn’t be able to kill Patrick as a Drakkon. You’d be shot down in the skies before you got near him.”
958. Unknown: “You let them transform me so that I could kill Patrick?”
959. Unknown: “Yes,”
960. Unknown: “And because you’re the only Drakkon strong enough to fight Patrick and live if he tries to take Garion from you before you kill him. You’re also the only Drakkon alive who truly understands what we’ve lost as a race. You won’t let us lose the last one.”
961. Unknown: “Patrick is the only White who knows the workings of the Phoenix Amber,”
962. Unknown: “If I kill him, I will forever remain a man.”
963. Unknown: “We cannot lose him,”
964. Unknown: “He is our greatest treasure.”
965. Unknown: “The treasure Patrick thinks I already have,”
966. Unknown: “What does Patrick mean to do with him?”
967. Unknown: “He wants to take his essence. With it, he can transform at will like the boy can.”
968. Unknown: “Garion would have to be dead to take his essence.”
969. Unknown: “I know.”
970. Unknown: “I won’t let anyone near him.”
971. Unknown: “Then you accept?”
972. Unknown: “Sam, I—”
973. Unknown: “Do what your heart tells you, Marcus. Garion is welcome to stay.”
974. Unknown: “Aye, Thomas, I accept. For now.”
975. Unknown: “I promise to pay for whatever he breaks.”
976. Unknown: “Although, if he keeps this up…”
977. Unknown: “I may have to tap into Marcus’s treasure since the man is his guardian after all.”
978. Unknown: “What kind of treasure does he have? Like…a mountain of jewels or something?”
979. Unknown: “Or something,”
980. Unknown: “Coffee?”
981. Unknown: “No tea?”
982. Unknown: “You must be from the States.”
983. Unknown: “You’ve managed to keep Marcus in one place longer than a se’nnight. And now I understand how. You are…”
984. Unknown: “What are you doing?”
985. Unknown: “Marcus!”
986. Unknown: “Don’t make her answer for you.”
987. Unknown: “Marcus! Stop it this instant!”
988. Unknown: “Let him go!”
989. Unknown: “He thinks to take you from me,”
990. Unknown: “I don’t belong to you.”
991. Unknown: “Very well, then.”
992. Unknown: “I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it with own eyes,”
993. Unknown: “Wouldn’t have believed what?”
994. Unknown: “How quickly you subdued him, for one. But more than that, his reaction to thinking I meant to take you from him.”
995. Unknown: “I know, and I’m sorry for that, Thomas. Did he hurt you?”
996. Unknown: “No, sweet, don’t you see? You’ve become his treasure.”
997. Unknown: “Did you finally tire of Thomas’s babbling?”
998. Unknown: “Thomas doesn’t babble,”
999. Unknown: “At least he doesn’t boss me around.”
1000. Unknown: “Boss. What does that mean?”
1001. Unknown: “It means he doesn’t tell me what to do. He doesn’t think he owns me, nor does he want to.”
1002. Unknown: “Own you?”
1003. Unknown: “That’s right.”
1004. Unknown: “He’s not an oaf…like you.”
1005. Unknown: “I’m not an oaf, Sam.”
1006. Unknown: “You are, Marcus.”
1007. Unknown: “I’ve been called many things, but I don’t like being called an oaf by you.”
1008. Unknown: “You don’t truly prefer Thomas over me, do you?”
1009. Unknown: “Well, he does have pretty hair.”
1010. Unknown: “Forgive my anger, Sam.”
1011. Unknown: “You have become very important to me. The thought of someone else…”
1012. Unknown: “There’s no one else. There’s only you.”
1013. Unknown: “Marry me, Sam.”
1014. Unknown: “What?”
1015. Unknown: “Marry me. Tomorrow. And then I’ll be your husband and I can own you properly.”
1016. Unknown: “Ah, good morn to you, lovely lady,”
1017. Unknown: “Thomas!”
1018. Unknown: “You’re always so pleasant in the morning.”
1019. Unknown: “Why shouldn’t he be?”
1020. Unknown: “He’s living here in this beautiful castle, free of charge.”
1021. Unknown: “Someone has to protect Sam against the beast that lives here,”
1022. Unknown: “I’m not a beast.”
1023. Unknown: “Are you two boys fighting?”
1024. Unknown: “Because I won’t have it. I’ll box both your ears.”
1025. Unknown: “My mother boxed my ears once. And let me tell you, your ears haven’t been boxed properly until they’ve been boxed with ten inch claws.”
1026. Unknown: “Well, I dare say!”
1027. Unknown: “Good lord!”
1028. Unknown: “I’m sorry.”
1029. Unknown: “Sorry for what?”
1030. Unknown: “You have nothing to be sorry for, Tabitha. Drakkons should be permitted to fly outside.”
1031. Unknown: “Bring him outside. Now!”
1032. Unknown: “You coming, Marcus?”
1033. Unknown: “Blaseiaaaaaaaa!”
1034. Unknown: “Well,”
1035. Unknown: “That’s one less for breakfast, Ellie.”
1036. Unknown: “Two,”
1037. Unknown: “You’re not having breakfast with us?”
1038. Unknown: “I’m going to stay out here and keep an eye on him.”
1039. Unknown: “We can call him in,”
1040. Unknown: “No. He’s having too much fun.”
1041. Unknown: “Why did he hunth you, Marcush?”
1042. Unknown: “Well, unlike the other knights, this one had a good reason,”
1043. Unknown: “You see, he loved a virgin that I had wanted to eat.”
1044. Unknown: “Whath is a virgin?”
1045. Unknown: “A virgin is a person who has not been touched or spoiled by…ehm…another person’s…essence. When a human bonds with another their body absorbs a part of their lov…ehm…mate.”
1046. Unknown: “Did you eath her?”
1047. Unknown: “No,”
1048. Unknown: “But it wasn’t because I couldn’t beat Sir Henry. It was because I didn’t want to beat him.”
1049. Unknown: “Why noth?”
1050. Unknown: “Because while I was busy licking my chops day-after-day over the virgin Isobelle, I was forced also to watch the way Henry loved her.”
1051. Unknown: “They called it courting back then,”
1052. Unknown: “Whath’s courthing?”
1053. Unknown: “You sure do ask a lot of questions.”
1054. Unknown: “Come, it’s time to return indoors. Keep your current form inside from now on and I’ll bring you flying daily.”
1055. Unknown: “Do we have a bargain?”
1056. Unknown: “Yes.”
1057. Unknown: “Marcus?”
1058. Unknown: “Do you like Sam?”
1059. Unknown: “Aye, I do,”
1060. Unknown: “I love her.”
1061. Unknown: “But Tabitha said one of the Whites told her you don’t love anything.”
1062. Unknown: “Well.”
1063. Unknown: “The White was wrong.”
1064. Unknown: “OH, THANK YOU for getting him to sleep.”
1065. Unknown: “I’ll have some peace tonight.”
1066. Unknown: “Where’s Sam?”
1067. Unknown: “We thought she was with you,”
1068. Unknown: “She isn’t answering me!”
1069. Unknown: “I cannot see her,”
1070. Unknown: “Did any of you hear a car?”
1071. Unknown: “I’m going to look for her,”
1072. Unknown: “I’ll take the car.”
1073. Unknown: “No.”
1074. Unknown: “If someone took Sam they might return for Garion if they read her thoughts about him. You need to stay here. I’ll find her.”
1075. Unknown: “What is it?”
1076. Unknown: “Sam was able to contact me, but she doesn’t know where she is. Also, she said a Drakkon had taken her. A Red.”
1077. Unknown: “It’s most likely Simion Red. He and Patrick are close. Patrick must have transformed him.”
1078. Unknown: “I have no proper weapon to fight a Drakkon, Thomas. Patrick wants Garion. I fear he may kill Sam if he doesn’t get him.”
1079. Unknown: “So, do we give up Garion then?”
1080. Unknown: “I cannot make this choice, Thomas. She…she means everything to me.”
1081. Unknown: “Marcus?”
1082. Unknown: “I don’t want harm to come to the boy,”
1083. Unknown: “He is our last hope. But I cannot live without Sam in my life.”
1084. Unknown: “Marcus?”
1085. Unknown: “Garion, go find Ellie and tell her Marcus and I said you can have a cookie.”
1086. Unknown: “Why don’t you use your fire on the Drakkon?”
1087. Unknown: “I can’t use it, Garion. I’m not a Drakkon anymore.”
1088. Unknown: “Do you want to be?”
1089. Unknown: “There you are!”
1090. Unknown: “Leave the men alone,”
1091. Unknown: “They have important things to discuss.”
1092. Unknown: “Do you want to be Drakkon again, Marcuth?”
1093. Unknown: “I could do it.”
1094. Unknown: “Tabitha, wait!”
1095. Unknown: “What can you do?”
1096. Unknown: “I can make you a Drakkon so you could fight better and bring Sam home. I like her.”
1097. Unknown: “How, how can you make me Drakkon again? I will not harm you for your essence.”
1098. Unknown: “You don’t have to hurt me. Just mix some of my blood with yours. A little will do it.”
1099. Unknown: “Did you know he could do this?”
1100. Unknown: “Why didn’t you tell me you had this power?”
1101. Unknown: “You like being a man.”
1102. Unknown: “Do you want to be a Drakkon, Marcuth?”
1103. Unknown: “No, Garion, I don’t.”
1104. Unknown: “Then, Samantha is your treasure.”
1105. Unknown: “Garion, if you transform me, will I remain a Drakkon?”
1106. Unknown: “No, you will be like me.”
1107. Unknown: “Let’s get to it then.”
1108. Unknown: “If we’re going to do this, Thomas interrupted his thoughts. “There are things we should discuss first.”
1109. Unknown: “Make it quick,”
1110. Unknown: “Well,”
1111. Unknown: “Simion won’t be expecting a Drakkon, so you have the element of surprise. But we still don’t know where he’s taken Sam. My onyx is still dark.”
1112. Unknown: “I’ll be able to smell him when I’m Drakkon.”
1113. Unknown: “Will you remember Sam after the change? There’s a chance…”
1114. Unknown: “I’ll remember her.”
1115. Unknown: “Perhaps I should transform and come with you,”
1116. Unknown: “I’ll stay here with Garion.”
1117. Unknown: “Now, little Drakkon, tell me what to do. Once we share blood, will I transform right away?”
1118. Unknown: “A Drakkon is coming.”
1119. Unknown: “How close?”
1120. Unknown: “How?”
1121. Unknown: “How long will it take?”
1122. Unknown: “And the same the other way around, aye?”
1123. Unknown: “Tell Patrick to come and get him.”
1124. Unknown: “Marrkiya! The boy!”
1125. Unknown: “You miss the sky,”
1126. Unknown: “I will rule them once again,”
1127. Unknown: “He’s going to kick your ass.”
1128. Unknown: “If he’s quick enough.”
1129. Unknown: “It doesn’t matter how quick he is. Have you seen the size of him? He isn’t a brick wall. He’s two. I’d be nervous if I were you.”
1130. Unknown: “You’re delightful!”
1131. Unknown: “I should have left you awake. You could have entertained me.”
1132. Unknown: “You can laugh, but your ass is getting kicked.”
1133. Unknown: “He races to your defense. He’s promised to toss my babes to the cliffs if I hurt you.”
1134. Unknown: “And do you want to know what he did to my wife?”
1135. Unknown: “No thank you.”
1136. Unknown: “He had sex with her, used her up and left me with her constant tears.”
1137. Unknown: “She almost emptied my bank account with the expensive gifts she bought him. The first night I tried to have sex with her, she rejected me. I wasn’t good enough anymore. I had no other choice, really.”
1138. Unknown: “What did you do?”
1139. Unknown: “I killed her, of course. We were no longer any use to each other.”
1140. Unknown: “You’re sick!”
1141. Unknown: “Perhaps. But I will be well soon.”
1142. Unknown: “How is this possible?”
1143. Unknown: “What have you done? Where is the child?”
1144. Unknown: “Not for long! I’ll use the Phoenix Amber to transform myself and then I’ll come after you, right after I slit the child’s throat and take his essence!”
1145. Unknown: “I’ve waited for this day for so long. Oh, how I’ve dreamed of killing you, of wiping your arrogant face from my memory.”
1146. Unknown: “I’ve got you,”
1147. Unknown: “I thought he killed you,”
1148. Unknown: “I transformed when the arrow struck me. As a man, the arrow has no effect. Thankfully, he only hit me in the shoulder. See? I am fine, my love.”
1149. Unknown: “I love you, Sam. You’re not going to get rid of me that easily.”
1150. Unknown: “You were Marrkiya,”
1151. Unknown: “I thought you’d given up being a man. I can see why you would. You’re a beautiful Drakkon, Marcus.”
1152. Unknown: “I know, my love.”
1153. Unknown: “I told you I wanted to be a man, and I meant it. Being Drakkon is wonderful and familiar, but I have come to know and feel something extraordinary. Love, more exhilarating than flying, more powerful than my fire, my scales, and my talons combined. Love for you and for Garion that has made me what I want to be, not a Drakkon, but a man, a husband, a father.”
1154. Unknown: “They thought my greatest treasure was the pride in my Drakkon blood, but they were wrong. My greatest treasure is you. My heart is yours and yours alone for as long as I live.”
1155. Unknown: “That’s a long time, Drakkon.”
1156. Unknown: “Aye,”
1157. Unknown: “We’ll have to do something about that.”
1158. Unknown: “I told you nothing fits him,”
1159. Unknown: “He’s too big!”
1160. Unknown: “He looks fine,”
